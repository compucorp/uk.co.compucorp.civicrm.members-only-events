civi-private-event-settings
===========================

This extension will add a radio group -> "Members event type" and a Drupal permission "Can register for Members events". If the "Members event Type" is not 'Public event', only a user with the "Can register for Members events" can register for the CiviCRM Event.

An duration check option is added in Administer menu to enable and disable the validation of membership duration.

Online registration needs to be enabled, when creating the Event in CiviCRM.
