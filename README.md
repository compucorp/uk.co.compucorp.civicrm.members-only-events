civi-private-event-settings
===========================

This extension will add a check box -> "Is members only event" and a Drupal permission "Can register for Members only events". If the "Is members only event" tick box is ticked, only a user with the "Can register for Members only events" can register for the Civi CRM Event.

Online registration needs to be enabled, when creating the Event in Civi CRM.
